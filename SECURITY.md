# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is a web application hosted on cloud infrastructure, we generally only support the latest deployed version.

| Version | Supported | Notes |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Production | :white_check_mark: | The current version deployed to <https://tenkeiaikidojo.org> |
| Development | :white_check_mark: | The current `main` branch |
| Older Tags | :x: | We do not backport security fixes to older commits. |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our members' data seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Tenkei Dojo platform (frontend or backend), please follow these steps:

### 🚫 Do NOT open a public GitHub issue

Public issues alert malicious actors to the vulnerability before we can fix it.

### ✅ How to report safely

Please report vulnerabilities privately via email to:
**<info@tenkeiaikidojo.org>**

If your report contains highly sensitive data, please encrypt your email using our PGP key:  
[Download Tenkei Dojo Public Key](https://tenkeiaikidojo.org/pgp.txt)
*(Fingerprint: C9DE 39F2 173B 6AC4 052B  3618 BE68 5510 C326 9728)*

Please include:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass).
2. **Location** (e.g., "The Registration API endpoint").
3. **Steps to reproduce** (A proof-of-concept script or screenshot is required).
4. **Impact** (What data or access is at risk?).

### Our Response Process

1. We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours**.
2. We will verify the issue and determine its severity.
3. We will deploy a fix to our staging environment for testing.
4. Once verified, we will deploy the fix to production.
5. We will notify you once the fix is live.

**Coordinated Disclosure:** Please allow us up to **90 days** to patch the vulnerability before discussing it publicly or publishing a CVE.  

## Scope

### In Scope

* The web application hosted at `https://tenkeiaikidojo.org`.
* The API endpoints and authentication flows (Go backend).
* Data privacy leaks, specifically concerning Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as mobile numbers, emails, and passwords.
* Bypasses of our Cloudflare Turnstile implementation.

### Out of Scope

* **Physical Security:** Do not attempt to physically access the Dojo or server locations.
* **Social Engineering:** Do not phishing our staff or members.
* **DDoS:** Do not attempt to flood our services (Cloudflare and Google Cloud already monitor this).
* **Third-Party Services:** Vulnerabilities in Cloudflare, Vercel, or Google Cloud Platform itself should be reported directly to those vendors.
* **Automated Scanners:** Unverified reports generated by automated scanning tools without a valid proof-of-concept.

### Known Intended Behaviors (Not Vulnerabilities)

* **404 Not Found on API Endpoints:** Our backend is protected by an `X-CF-Bypass` middleware. Direct requests to the backend without the correct Cloudflare header will intentionally return a `404 Not Found` to mask the service. This is by design and not a routing error.
* **Payload Caps:** The API intentionally rejects large JSON payloads to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Safe Harbor

If you follow these guidelines and act in good faith to identify and report vulnerabilities, we commit to:

* No voodoo, spells, or hexing against researchers acting in good faith.
* Working with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
* Publicly acknowledging your contribution (if you wish) once the issue is resolved.
* Not initiating legal action or law enforcement investigations against you related to your research. Ugh who has that time and energy?

## Bug Bounty

As Tenkei Aikidojo is a non-profit organization run by volunteers, we currently **do not offer financial rewards or bug bounties** for vulnerability reports. We deeply appreciate the time and effort of security researchers who help keep our community safe, and we are happy to provide public acknowledgment or recommendations for valid, impactful reports.
